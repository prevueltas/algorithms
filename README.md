# Grokking Algorithms

This repo contains mainly an implementation of the algorithms described in the book "Grooking Algorithms", by Aditya Y. 
Bhargava, but also inspired from other sources that I reference as comments.

* [Selection Sort](/algorithms/selection_sort.py) - O(n^2)
* [Quicksort](/algorithms/quicksort.py) - O(n * log n)
* [K-nearest-neighbors or KNN](/algorithms/knn.py) - O(n * log n)
